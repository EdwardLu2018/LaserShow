## Current Features
1. Draws user-inputted coordinates unto special light-tracing paper
2. Draws cyclic curves with amplitudes and wavelengths (in the x and y direction) that can be changed with knobs/potentiometers

## To be Implemented
1. Drawing polar curves
2. Using Python serial communication to get user input
