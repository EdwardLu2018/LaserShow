# Laser Light Show

Formerly a project with Joe Muskin and Prof. Arend van der Zande at UIUC for engineering outreach <br>
Currently revived as a passion project. Adding new features

## Current Features

1. Draws user-inputted coordinates unto special light-tracing paper
2. Draws cyclic curves with amplitudes and wavelengths (in the x and y direction) that can be changed with knobs/potentiometers

## To be Implemented
1. Drawing polar curves
2. Using python serial communication to get user input
